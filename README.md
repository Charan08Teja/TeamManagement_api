# TeamManagement_api
The TeamManagement_API is a Spring Boot-based backend application designed to streamline team and project management. It provides RESTful endpoints to handle tasks, users, roles, and projects â€” enabling structured collaboration, assignment tracking, and permission-based role management.
This API supports functionalities like:

Creating and managing users with secure authentication

Assigning roles such as project manager or team member

Creating and organizing projects with timelines

Assigning tasks with priorities and statuses

Tracking who is responsible for what and when

It is built with modularity in mind, using Spring Data JPA for data persistence, and supports PostgreSQL as the underlying database.
